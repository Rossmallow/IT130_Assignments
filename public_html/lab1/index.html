        <li> The difference between a web server and a web client is that a web server hosts websites, and a web client accesses websites.</li>
        <li> A web server is used to serve an HTML document to web clients that request it. If a document is just stored locally and not made publicly available like it would be on a server, clients will not be able to find it.</li>
        <li> The document type statement is required to let the web client know what kind of document it is reading. The file will be read differently depending on the type of document it is.</li>
        <li> Every HTML document needs a document type statement at the bare minimum. The meta tag with the charset attribute set to some value is recommended due to a common hack.</li>
        <li> The &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;img&gt; tags don't contain any content, and therefore don't need to be closed around anything.</li>
        <li> To subscribe to News postings in D2L, first click on the drop-down-arrow next to the desired news feed. Next, click on the "Notifications" option to be taken to a new page. Select which occasions to receive sms and/or email notifications.</li>
        <li> A student who scores less than 50% on the Final can only earn at most a C+ in the class.</li>
        <li> The lowest assignment grade will be dropped.</li>
        <li> Missing four or more classes will result in the student losing one final course grade point per class missed. Perfect attendance will be rewarded with bonus points. A missed class is one where the student arrives more than 15 minutes late, or leaves class before invited to do so. Each student has three permitted grace absences.</li>
        <li> The use of cellphones and computers in class is not allowed unless otherwise specified.</li>
        <li> I used Brackets on a university desktop to create this document. I had no issues with the editor.</li>
        <li> I have no outstanding questions about the material so far.</li>
